# Potential Datasets
###### Name of Dataset: Water_Quality__LA_.csv 
###### Dataset 1 analyzes water quality data in Los Angeles. This data provides the location water was tested and the contaminent ratio found at each location. This dataset could be used to create a more specific data collection method that can tell us why these have high level counts. Is plumbing updated?
###### Dataset Source: This data was downloaded from Kaggle [Datasource1](https://www.kaggle.com/peternooteboom/los-angeles-water-quality)
###### [Repo1](https://github.com/stephandrade14/up206a---StephanieA/blob/main/data/Water_Quality__LA_.csv)

###### Name of Dataset: Fast_Food_Restaurants_US.csv
###### Dataset 2 includes locations for fast food restaurants in California. The original data was found on Kaggle but I want to focus on a project that is more specific to California. I was able to trim the data to only inlcude California locations of fast food. Ultimately, I want to see if there might be some corrilation between number of fast food locations and food disparity in certain areas of California, low income communities of color with less grocery stores.
