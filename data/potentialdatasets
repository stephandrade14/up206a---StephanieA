# Potential Datasets
###### Name of Dataset: Water_Quality__LA_.csv 
###### Dataset 1 analyzes water quality data in Los Angeles. This data provides the location water was tested and the contaminent ratio found at each location.
###### This dataset could be used to create a more specific data collection method that can tell us why these have high level counts. Is plumbing updated? Are these counts seen weekly daily?
###### Dataset Source: This data was downloaded from Kaggle [link to Datasource 1] (https://www.kaggle.com/peternooteboom/los-angeles-water-quality)
