# Stephanie Andrade :smiley:

###### Hello everyone, my name is Stephanie and I am a second year MURP concentrating in Environmental Analysis and Policy. I recevied my undergraduate degree in Biology so I am very excited to be learning some new programming in this course and a different way of analyzing datasets (I am only familiar with R). I am very familiar with Excel and organizing large datasets. 

# Project Ideas
## Environmental Issues: 
###### 1. Climate Change
###### 2. Water Accessibility and Health
###### 3. Stormwater Management in Los Angeles. 

# Objectives
###### 1. I want to be able to create data maps that are appealing and easy to read
###### 2. Develop skills using Python!
###### 3. Understand GIS enough that I can explain to someone how to use it
