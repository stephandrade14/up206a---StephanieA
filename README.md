### Hello everyone, my name is Stephanie and I am a second year MURP concentrating in Environmental Analysis and Policy. I recevied my undergraduate degree in Biology so I am very excited to be learning some new programming in this course and a different way of analyzing datasets (I am only familiar with R). I am very familiar with Excel and organizing large datasets. During my time in this course I am really interested in focusing on data that revolves around Environmental Issues: Climate Change, Water Accessibility and Health, and Stormwater Management in Los Angeles. 

# Objectives
### I want to be able to create data maps that are appealing and easy to read
### Develop skills using Python!
### Understand GIS enough that I can explain to someone how to use it
